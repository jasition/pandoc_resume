Working Experiences
----------

**Tech Lead, N26 GmbH Barceonla Sucursal E, Barcelona, Mar 2019 - Present:**
*Product Service* (http://www.n26.com). An online branch-less modern commercial bank whose main revenue source comes from premium subscription. Product Service was created in managing the lifecycle of a membership subscription, keeping customers informed and promoted the values of premium memberships. It was a monolithic service that was being slimmed down by extracting microservices out of its scope. Heavily exercised A/B testing in verifying product ideas before fully invested in a comprehensive solution. Heavily exercised event-driven design, hexagonal architecture, and domain-driven design principles in re-defining the bounded-context of microservices around the service eco-system. Each responsible microservice went through CQRS analysis and event storming. Used Kotlin as primary language and Java 11 as secondary.  

**Technical Lead, IG Group, London, Jun 2015 - Mar 2019:**

*Spectrum Markets* (https://www.spectrum-markets.com). A new institutional Exchange system as a Greenfield project. Combined Event-Sourcing, CQRS, SOLID Principles, Functional Programming, Full TDD / BDD at all levels in Testing Pyramid. Used Hexagonal Architecture as application methodology. Used Docker as the local dev tool and built a CI/CD pipeline for future. Used Confinity (formerly IBM) Low-latency Messaging, Reuters RFA, Elektron, QuickfixJ, Spring Boot, Core Java 8 and other Java utilities (Lombok, Vavr, Guava, Immutables, Cucumber, JMH Benchmarking) as the technology stack. The sole author of the FIX Rules of Engagement for the Exchange. Matching latency was down to 9 milliseconds for 5-level depth book.

*NADEX* (https://www.nadex.com/). As the trade volume doubled every two years, the Exchange system finally saturated and scalability improvement was required. Terracotta FX was replaced by local cache. Redhat MRG QPID was replaced by IBM LLM. Reuters RFA was used to distribute Market data. Quote throughput was boosted from 3000 to 6000 per second, and order latency was down to sub-milliseconds.

*IGFX FX Price Aggregator*. The FX Spot price aggregator and order router required a separation of price streams between client orders and hedging function. Connected with 14 liquidity providers (e.g. BAML, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, HSBC) in setting up and onboarding of the new price FIX feeds and new trade FIX feeds. Performed conformity testing and conducted live test trades with the dealers.
